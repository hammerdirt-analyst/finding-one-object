# The probability of trash

## An interpretation of beach-litter survey results using the Beta - Binomial conjugate model

_Version 1, status **unpublished and in progress**_

Beach litter survey results are considered from the standpoint of risk and a simple probabilistic models. The Beta - Binomial conjugate model is used to identify the probability of finding a feminine hygiene product (FHP) on the shores of Lake Geneva, Switzerland. The model is then used to develop a sampling strategy in Geneva that maximizes the chances of finding an FHP at the next survey.
